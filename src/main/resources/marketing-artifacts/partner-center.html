<h2>Short description</h2>
<p>Provisions an IBM WebSphere Application Server (traditional) Network Deployment cluster on Azure Virtual Machines, including the

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>IBM WebSphere Application Server (traditional) is an industry-leading Java runtime powering some of the most mission critical
enterprise applications across geographies and environments. This solution automates most boilerplate steps to provision a WebSphere

further. The solution is jointly developed by IBM and Microsoft.</p>
<p>The following resources are automatically provisioned by the offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) VMs with fixes (you can choose the number of VMs
- all Worker Nodes will have private IP addresses)</li>
<li>Latest WebSphere Application Server ND 9.0.5.x on each VM with fixes
(<b>WAS_INSTALL_ROOT</b> is <b>/datadrive/IBM/WebSphere/ND/V9</b>).</li>
<li>Latest IBM JDK 8 with fixes on each VM (<strong>JAVA_HOME</strong> is <strong>${WAS_INSTALL_ROOT}/java/8.0</strong>)</li>
<li>Deployment Manager on one of the VMs with Administrative Console enabled - with a public IP address</li>
<li>IBM HTTP Server (IHS) or Azure Application Gateway as load balancer over Worker Nodes - you can also skip
provisioning a load balancer</li>
<li>IHS on a VM with a public IP address</li>
<li>Azure App Gateway instance with a public IP address</li>
<li>Configured data source connection (Db2, Oracle DB, Azure SQL) - optional</li>
<li>Virtual network and at least one subnet -
two subnets are needed to use Azure Application Gateway (alternatively, you can deploy to an existing virtual network)</li>
<li>Network security group</li>
<li>OS and data disks attached to each VM</li>
<li>Storage account for VM boot diagnostics, and sharing files if using IHS</li>
</ul>
<p>This offer supports both evaluation and Bring-Your-Own-License (BYOL) options for WebSphere. When using BYOL you will be required to
enter your registered IBM ID prior to successfully deploying this offer and your IBM ID must have active WebSphere entitlements
associated with it. If you find that provisioning fails due to lack of entitlements, please contact the primary or secondary contacts for
your IBM Passport Advantage Site who should be able to grant you access. The evaluation option is limited to 60 days, at which point you
must remove the deployment or acquire entitlement.</p>
<p>IBM and Microsoft also provide basic step-by-step instructions on getting started with WebSphere and RHEL without automated
provisioning.</p>
<p>IBM and Microsoft provide similar solutions targeting WebSphere single instance on an Azure VM, WebSphere VM Images (ND, Base, or HTTP Server), 
WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) and WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
